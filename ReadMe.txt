Version Notes:
==============

WidgetApp_v1.0 (version 1.0)
----------------------------

This version directly access the database for fetching the data. Once the API is ready, the source code has to be modified to support the API. There is no need to change the entire code for future versions. Just change the database connection and accessing parts with API.

In the future versions, don't forget to sign the widgetApp.exe (project output) file. Then include this signed file while making your setup file. After creating the setup file, sign the setup file again with the certificate. You can found the certificate file in 'Zip2Tax\Digital Certificates' folder.
